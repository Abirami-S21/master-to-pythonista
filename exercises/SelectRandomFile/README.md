# Find Word Frequency

This program can select `n` random file(s) from a directory and copy it on the destination directory.

It can catch an exception and show it to the user. Currently, only directory that didn't have another directory in it is supported. It is open for anyone to improve/make an enhancement to my code. Thanks!
